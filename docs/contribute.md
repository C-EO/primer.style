# Contributing to Primer

There are several ways you can contribute to and participate in Primer:

- Participate in discussions
- Submit an issue
- Improve the documentation
- Close issues
- Propose a new component or UI pattern
- Questions and support

Please note that all contributions to Primer need to follow our code of conduct.

## Participate in discussions

Discussions about improvements and upcoming work happen mostly in issues and in the #design-system Slack channel. These are the repos you should watch if you’re interested in getting involved:

- Design
- Primer CSS
- Primer Components (React)
- Octicons
- ...

The Design Systems Team holds office hours twice a week and anyone at GitHub is free to join, ask questions and participate in ongoing conversations.

## Submit an issue 

If you spot something that doesn’t look right in our design, code or documentation, use one of the issue templates to submit an issue.

Before submitting an issue, do a quick search to check the same issue hasn’t been submitted yet. If it has, you can add to the discussion with your own examples and ideas.


## Improve the documentation

Documentation is a core part of Primer, and, just as design and code, we’re always trying to make it better and more useful. If you notice something missing, a typo, or have an idea of how the docs can be improved, check if the issue already exists, and, if not, you can do one of the following:

- Submit an issue 
- Submit a pull request with a fix (you can do this directly via the “Edit this page on GitHub” link on the footer of docs pages)

## Close issues

There are issues marked with the label “status: help wanted” in the design-systems repo that we’d love some help with. If you think you can help, add a comment on the issue stating when and (if you know) how you’ll be able to tackle it and we’ll support you throughout. 

## Propose a new component or UI pattern


## Questions and support

If you’re GitHub staff, the quickest way to get help is to ask your question in the #design-systems Slack channel. Otherwise, send us a message on Twitter [@githubprimer](https://twitter.com/githubprimer) and we’ll get back to you.
